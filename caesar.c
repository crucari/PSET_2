// Unencrypted text is generally called plaintext. Encrypted text is generally called ciphertext. And the secret used is called a key.

// More generally, Caesarâ€™s algorithm (i.e., cipher) encrypts messages by "rotating" each letter by k positions.
// More formally, if p is some plaintext (i.e., an unencrypted message), pi is the ith character in p, and k is a secret key (i.e., a non-negative integer),
// then each letter, ci, in the ciphertext, c, is computed as

// ci=(pi+k)mod26

// Steps:
// 1) Get the key
        // -get it using the commandline arguement
        // -atoi

        //argc and argv
// 2) Get the plain text
// 3) Encipher
// 4) Print cipher text
